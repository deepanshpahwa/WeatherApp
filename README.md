Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course.
I have use multiple libraries in this app- Retrofit, GSON, Sqlite etc and I have implemented a lot of advanced features- view pagers, animations, Recyycler View etc. 
I developed this app when I started android, this doesn't define what I know about android and mobile development. To know more about me and my work experience in this field, please look for my resume in the repos.
